# Rails as an API Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Please note:

-   Many of the readings will mention the "view" layer. We won't be covering the
    view layer in this program.
-   We'll use our [Rails API Template](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-template)
    repository as the basis for our rails applications.
    This template excludes the "view" layer.

## Define Model Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the model layer are in
Rails.

```md
The model layer is synonomous with the database; it handles storage and retrieval of data.
```

## Define Controller Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the controller layer are
in Rails.

```md
The controller is a middle man between the user interface (view) and the database (model).  The controller asks the model for data, and gives it to the view to be displayed.
```

## Define Router Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the router does in Rails.

```md
The router takes http requests and decides which controller should handle the request.
```

## The Request-Response Cycle in Rails

Starting with a client making a GET request to a particular URL, describe how
the parts of Rails interact to produce and send a response.

```md
A client makes a GET request to a URL -> the web server uses the Rails router to decide which Rails controller should handle the request -> the Rails controller asks the Rails database to provide the correct data needed to fulfill the request -> upon receiving the correct data, the controller provides that data to the rails view (or other framework) to display.
```
